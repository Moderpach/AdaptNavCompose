# AdaptNavCompose

> [!CAUTION]
> Deprecated because official Navigation3 released

AdaptNavCompose provides a clean, extendable and elegant implementation of
adaptive layout and navigation for Jetpack Compose.

You don't need to maintain complex, nested navigation for adaptive layouts
or manage multiple `NavController` and `NavHost`.

## Get Start

build.gradle.kts

```kotlin
  implementation("io.github.moderpach:compose-navigation-adaptive:0.0.1")
```
